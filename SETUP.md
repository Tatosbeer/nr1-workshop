# Welcome!

It's quick and easy to set up your environment to build [New Relic One applications](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/new-relic-programmable-platform-introduction). In these setup instructions, you'll be setting up your system to run a local server that establishes a connection to the New Relic One platform. This connection makes building your New Relic One application easy because you can see your changes in real time. Enjoy!

# Setup Instructions

To set up your environment to Build your own application:

1. In Google Chrome, go to [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/) and select [**build your own application**](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/developer-center.launcher#pane=eyJuZXJkbGV0SWQiOiJkZXZlbG9wZXItY2VudGVyLmRldmVsb3Blci1jZW50ZXIifQ==). Follow the instructions.

# Important

Some customers have enterprise-wide agreements with New Relic, prohibiting employees from accepting the Terms and Conditions of the developer program. Those persons will be unable to download the CLI. If you're effected by this, please reach out to your legal department and/or contact your New Relic sales representative to explore alternatives for becoming familiar with this material while honoring your company's employee policies.

2. To prepare to do the workshop, you need to clone the workshop repo:

```bash
# if you haven't cloned the workshop repo already
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop.git
```

_Note: Each exercise exists as a folder in this repository. Following the material will involve going into that directory, running `npm install`, standing up the local development server by running `nr1 nerdpack:serve`, and following the INSTRUCTIONS.md in the given folder._

3. Now start the `setup` NR1 package:

```bash
# ex. change directory into setup
cd nr1-workshop/setup
npm install
nr1 nerdpack:uuid -gf
nr1 nerdpack:serve
```

Your terminal output should look like the following:

4. Open Google Chrome and go to [one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local](https://one.newrelic.com?nerdpacks=local) (this places locally served applications in New Relic One). Click on the launcher named `Setup exercise`. You should see the following:
