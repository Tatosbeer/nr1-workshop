# workshop lab/0

This repo has been spun up locally only

## Getting started

1. Open a Terminal window.
2. Type `nr1 --version` to confirm that you can run the CLI
3. If you can't run that command, go to the **Build your own application** launcher in New Relic One, register for a developer API key and download the `nr1` CLI. See the complete [Setup instructions](../SETUP.md) for more details
4. And if you haven't already cloned the workshop repo, do that now.

```bash
# if you haven't cloned the workshop repo already
git clone https://github.com/newrelic/nr1-workshop.git
# or if you have SSH keys registered with your account
# git clone git@github.com:newrelic/nr1-workshop.git

# then change directory into lab0
cd nr1-workshop/lab0
```
