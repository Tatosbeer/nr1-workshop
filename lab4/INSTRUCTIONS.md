# Prerequisite - Understanding GraphQL
The purpose of this section is to orient you to GraphQL, a "query language" for New Relic's API. Naturally, this section is very "New Relic focused." There are links provided at that bottom of this page for more general GraphQL information.

GraphQL has some key differences when compared to REST. For example, it's the client, not the server, that determines what data will be returned. Also, it becomes easy to collect data from multiple sources. In the case of New Relic, we'll see you can get account information, data about infrastructure, and issue a NRQL request, **all in one GraphQL query**.

## Getting an API Key

Before you use the [NerdGraph API Explorer](https://api.newrelic.com/graphiql) in the following exercises, [create a new user key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-api-key).

## Exercises

The exercises in this section that will give you some hands on experience using "GraphiQL" a web based tool that will issue queries to New Relic's GraphQL service. These are designed to be walked through in order, as the concepts in the lessons build on each other. Start now with Schema Introspection and work your way through to being able to issue a GraphQL query that pulls data from multiple sources, including NRQL!

* [Exercise 2 - Retrieving Infrastructure Information](2-InfrastructureServices.md)
* [Exercise 3 - Using Mutations to Update Data](3-Mutation-InfrastructureServices.md)
* [Exercise 4 - Using NRQL with GraphQL](4-QueryWithNRQL.md)

<sup>Note: Some of these can be very opinionated regarding REST vs. GraphQL. From our perspective, both REST and GraphQL are, and will remain important technologies and tools in our portfolio. </sup>
